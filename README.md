# nodejs-crud-app
Built with Restify for server, Mongoose for MongoDB, and JWT authentication 

Based on the awesome YouTube video tutorials by Brad Traversy

It uses Restify in place of Express JS for the server. And creates an API endpoint that you can use to create, read, update and delete _**C.R.U.D**_ :thinking: :smile:

It was a great project, and a good way to get up and running with MongoDB without too much work. As it is hosted for free by [MLab](https://www.mlab.com)
